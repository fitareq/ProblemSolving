# Rotate Array

## Problem Description

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
- Rotate 1 step to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
- Rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
- Rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
- Rotate 1 step to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
- Rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`
## Approach

One simple approach to solve this problem is to rotate the array in multiple steps, each time moving the last element to the front. However, this approach would require multiple iterations and can be inefficient.

A more efficient approach involves using the reverse technique. We can reverse the entire array, then reverse the first `k` elements, and finally reverse the remaining elements. This rotation operation effectively rotates the array to the right by `k` steps.

## Algorithm

1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining elements.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are performing the rotations in-place.
